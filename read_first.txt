Hello sir, 

This final version of my project is different from the first submission mostly because I found most of the php code on internet so I had to adjust and modify to fit it better.

Code is curated mostly from Stack Overflow and through various sources from GitHub. It is done this way since I had little to no experience in styling with Bootstrap and doing backend development using PhP engine so I had to google and copy stuff. I am not trying to excuse myself from not practicing it more but I am trying to be transparent about my knowledge in this area. 


Database Configuration
----------------------

Password you find inside the configuration files is set for my local server so you'd probably had to modify that.
